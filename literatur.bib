  abstract      = {Cyber‐physical systems (CPSs) are used across domains to enable process optimization and previously unachievable functionality. The combination of networked digital systems and analog physical processes creates unique characteristics that change how security theory is applied. Neither cyber‐ nor physical‐security concepts alone can protect CPSs because the crossover effects can introduce unexpected vulnerabilities. Physical attacks may allow access to critical assets, resulting in damage or compromise of information being processed by the device, while cyber‐attacks may cause physical malfunctions, resulting in real‐world consequences. Therefore, security and privacy are key concerns for CPS design, development, and operation. In this chapter, we discuss how CPS security and privacy differ from that of pure cyber or physical systems and what may be done to secure these systems. Our goal is to help designers of emerging CPSs to build more secure, privacy‐enhanced products in the future.},

  abstract      = {Fog/edge computing has been proposed to be integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) to enable computing services devices deployed at network edge, aiming to improve the user's experience and resilience of the services in case of failures. With the advantage of distributed architecture and close to end-users, fog/edge computing can provide faster response and greater quality of service for IoT applications. Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT should be explored. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to be implemented in real-world applications.},

However, security and privacy issues are a great challenge for IoT but they are also enabling factors to create a “trust ecosystem.” In fact, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of IoT devices, with limited resources and heterogeneous technologies, together with the lack of specifically designed IoT standards, represent a fertile ground for the expansion of specific cyber threats. In this paper, we try to bring order on the IoT security panorama providing a taxonomic analysis from the perspective of the three main key layers of the IoT system model: 1) perception; 2) transportation; and 3) application levels. As a result of the analysis, we will highlight the most critical issues with the aim of guiding future research directions.},

They are used in our homes, in hospitals, deployed outside to control and report the changes in environment, prevent fires, and many more beneficial functionality. However, all those benefits can come of huge risks of privacy loss and security issues. To secure the IoT devices, many research works have been conducted to countermeasure those problems and find a better way to eliminate those risks, or at least minimize their effects on the user's privacy and security requirements. The survey consists of four segments. The first segment will explore the most relevant limitations of IoT devices and their solutions. The second one will present the classification of IoT attacks. The next segment will focus on the mechanisms and architectures for authentication and access control. The last segment will analyze the security issues in different layers.},

Work in IoT tends toward the subsystem, often focusing on particular technical concerns or application domains, before offloading data to the cloud. As such, there has been little regard given to the security, privacy, and personal safety risks that arise beyond these subsystems; i.e., from the wide-scale, cross-platform openness that cloud services bring to IoT. In this paper, we focus on security considerations for IoT from the perspectives of cloud tenants, end-users, and cloud providers, in the context of wide-scale IoT proliferation, working across the range of IoT technologies (be they things or entire IoT subsystems). Our contribution is to analyze the current state of cloud-supported IoT to make explicit the security considerations that require further work.},
